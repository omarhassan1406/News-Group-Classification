### News Group Classification using NLP Algorithm.

This project is a News Group Classification system that uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to automatically categorize news articles into different categories based on their content. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the category of a given news article, such as sports, politics, technology, or entertainment.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a large collection of news articles from various sources, which are labeled with their corresponding category. The dataset was preprocessed by cleaning and transforming the text into a format that can be used by the NLP algorithm.

#NLP Algorithm

The NLP algorithm used in this project is based on deep learning techniques, specifically a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The algorithm was trained on the preprocessed dataset using a custom loss function and a softmax activation function.

#Results

The trained NLP model was able to achieve an accuracy of over 90% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting the category of news articles. The project also includes a web application that allows users to input text and get a prediction of its corresponding news category.

#Usage

To use the News Group Classification system, simply clone the repository and run the classify_news.py script, which takes a newsarticle as input and outputs its predicted category. Alternatively, you can use the web application by running the app.py script and navigating to the URL displayed in the terminal.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using NLP algorithms for News Group Classification, and provides a practical solution for automatically categorizing news articles based on their content. The project also serves as a valuable learning experience for those interested in natural language processing and deep learning, and can be used as a basis for future research in this area.
